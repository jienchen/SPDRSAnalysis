This is my attempt at the 2016 assignment for the Viewtrade internship.
I created a local Apache server and MySQL server using XAMPP to test my code.
I named my database etfcsv and each ticker code had its own table named after itself.
In the screenshots folder, you will find sample webpages that are produced from entering a ticker code.
Login/registration is not implemented but the shell/appearance of the pages are there.
To utilize the parser from index.php, just enter any username and password or enter the ticker code from user.php.
Most of the code will be in processing/parse.php and sample .csv files are also provided.
I used PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser (http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) for this project and the simple_html_dom.php file is in the processing folder as well.
For the charts, I used AmCharts.
